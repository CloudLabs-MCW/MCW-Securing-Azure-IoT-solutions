## Exercise 8: Configure security and alerts

Duration: 20 minutes

This exercise will evaluate the logs from when you enabled diagnostic logging on your Azure resources and then setup some alerts based on any important configuration changes that an Azure user may make to your IoT infrastructure.  You will also setup a baseline such that if a local user makes a change on your IoT Device, the security agent will make note of it and notify you.

### Task 1: Create IoT Baseline checks

1. Switch to the Azure Portal and your lab resource group.

2. Select the **oilwells-iothub-[YOUR INIT]** IoT Hub.

3. Under **Automatic Device Management**, select **IoT Edge**.

4. Select the **oilwells-edge-001** device.

5. Select the **azureiotsecurty** module.

6. Select the **Module Identity Twin** tab.

7. Find the `desired` section of the twin, add the `ms_iotn:urn_azureiot_Security_SecurityAgentConfiguration` property with the following:

    ```json
        "ms_iotn:urn_azureiot_Security_SecurityAgentConfiguration": {
            "baselineCustomChecksEnabled": {
            "value" : true
            },
            "baselineCustomChecksFilePath": {
            "value" : "/home/wsuser/oms_audits.xml"
            },
            "baselineCustomChecksFileHash": {
            "value" : "9026e50c728fe00edcc9d46f2cdb3346425931889730cbf970ccb368dfa2296e"
            }
        }
    ```

    > **Note**: You can use the [sha256sum](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sha256sum) tool in Linux to create a file hash.

    ![The baseline properties are added to the device twin in the Azure IoT Edge Module Twin configuration.](media/devicetwin-baselinechecks.png "Add the baseline properties to the twin")

8. Select **Save**.

9. Switch to your terminal/SSH/putty session connected to the **oilwells-edge-001** IoT Device, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /home/wsuser/oms_audit.xml
    ```

10. Copy and paste the local `/Hands-on lab/scripts/oms_audits.xml` or [remote](../Hands-on%20lab/Scripts/oms_audits.xml) file content into the session window, then save it.

### Task 2: Review Azure Security for IoT log data

1. Switch to the Azure Portal and your resource group.

2. Select the **oilwells-iothub-[YOUR INIT]** IoT Hub.

3. In the blade menu, in the **Security** section, select **Overview**, you will get a dashboard of potential security recommendations you should consider.

4. Under **Security**, select **Security Alerts**, you should see several alerts displayed.

5. Under **Security**, select **Recommendations**, you should see our attack items displayed.

    ![In the IoT Hub Security tab, under Recommendations, Azure recommends closing device ports. This recommendation was generated from the previous brute force attack.](media/ex6_image021.png "Device has open ports security recommendation in IoT Hub")

    >**Note**: It may take 10-15 minutes for them to be displayed.

6. Select the **Device has open ports** recommendation.  In the dialog, select the **To see which devices have this recommendation...** link.  This will navigate to the Log Analytics portal when you can drill deeper into the log data that caused the alert.

7. Expand the log.

### Task 3: Create custom security alerts for device events

1. From the **oilwells-iothub-[YOUR INIT]** IoT Hub blade, in the **Security** section, select **Settings**, then select **Custom Alerts**.

2. Select the **default** security group.

3. Select **Create custom alert rule**.

    ![This image shows how to create a new Custom Alert in the IoT Hub Security section. Create custom alert rule is highlighted.](media/ex6_image002.png "Create custom alert rule link highlighted")

4. Review the available options, then select **Number of failed local logins is not in allowed range**.

    ![The create a custom alert rule dialog is displayed with the fields filled in.](media/ex6_image003.png "Create a custom alert rule window")

5. Select **OK**.

6. Select **Save**.  In addition to the custom alerts you can create, you will also see default ones fire such as successful logins.

    let device = "YOUR_DEVICE_ID";
    let hub = "YOUR_HUB_NAME";
    SecurityIoTRawEvent
    | where
        DeviceId == device and AssociatedResourceId contains tolower(hub)
        and RawEventName == "Login"
        // filter out local, invalid and failed logins
        and EventDetails contains "RemoteAddress"

    ```

    ![This image shows the results from the above User Access query.](media/iothub-investigate-2.png "Kusto Query results set")

    > **Note**: Are you surprised by the results? Having a device on the internet provides opportunity for bad actors to gain access to your device!

6. Highlight the query, then select **Run**. Review the results.

7. If you would like to get logs from Azure Sentinel or Log analytics for **Azure Defender for IoT**, you can run the following query:
