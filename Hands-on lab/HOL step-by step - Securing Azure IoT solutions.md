# Securing Azure IoT solutions hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will implement an IoT solution that utilizes the latest Azure Security IoT features.  Specifically, you will provision a set of Azure resources that will securely manage your IoT infrastructure and devices.  This includes provisioning Azure IoT Edge devices with supporting modules and agents.

Once deployed and configured, you will simulate various events from devices that generate specific alerts in the Azure Security Center for IoT.  Use these alerts to diagnose issues with your devices and execute commands to remediate those issues.

At the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how the latest Azure Security features work with IoT environments and how to install, configure and troubleshoot issues.

## Overview

Contoso, Ltd. has major holdings in one of the world’s most important oil-producing regions. To overcome the challenges of monitoring and optimizing a vast number of widely dispersed field assets, Contoso, Ltd. is looking to streamline its operations with IoT solutions. They want to deploy IoT technologies to electronically collect data and use cloud-based solutions to store and analyze it in order to gain new insights into well operations and future drilling possibilities.

Their environments are very tough environments in which to work. The climate is hot, harsh, and unforgiving, and oil wells are often spaced many miles apart, so field technicians can spend much of their day just driving from one to another. Cellular and radio reception is spotty at best, so collecting data about well conditions and performance typically involves manually writing down information. The technician must then make the long trek to the central office at the end of the day to upload the data for analysis. With such remote situations, a key concern for Contoso is not only how they manage these remote devices, but more broadly how they secure the complete solution that encompasses the physical device, the software on the device, the services processing the data in the cloud and the network connecting it all.

Contoso plans to tie into existing sensors at the well head that monitor key system parameters like temperatures, pressures, and flow rates. They will deploy gateway devices to route device data for processing, storage and analytics. Internal IT staff and engineers want to visualize the high-resolution data and deliver near real-time analyses. The company is placing a premium on flexibility and ease of use, with security as a fundamental driver.

In addition, they would also like the solution to yield benefits to their workers in the field. “The field technicians and lease operators already have tools on their phones that they use every day to see what a well is doing,” explains Miles Strom. “Our goal is to connect these tools to live data from the IoT sensors. So, instead of seeing low-resolution volumes or flow rates, they’ll see what is happening in real time. This way they can respond immediately to problems that lead to downtime or maintenance issues.”

They have implemented a proof-of-concept solution for collecting and analyzing device telemetry using IoT Hub, but are interested in learning about any related services in Azure that would help them to secure such solutions.

> **Note**: These labs focus solely on device security and do not explore analytics or data processing in depth. Stream Analytics and Service Bus are not presented in these labs. Additionally, you would need Azure Sphere hardware and connectivity to such devices in order to review full end to end (E2E) security components and topics such as highly secure remote upgrades. As such, you will not see these topics covered in these labs.

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

    - Trial subscriptions will not work.

## Before the hands-on lab

Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide manual before continuing to the lab exercises.

> **Note**: As part of the deployment, both ports 3389 and 22 will be open on the Network Security Group.  It is advisable that you modify the NSG settings to only allow your internet IP to connect to those ports.
> **Note**: Previous versions of this lab used a previous version of IoT Edge (`<=1.09`), but has since been upgraded to use `1.2` or later.

## Exercise 1: Secure and configure IoT Hub and Device Provisioning Service

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will link your provisioning service to your IoT Hub.  Once this is complete, you will enable the Azure Security Center for IoT on your IoT Hub.  With this plumbing in place, you can start creating your device enrollments and to provision your IoT devices.

## Exercise 2: Enroll and provision IoT devices

Duration: 30 minutes

With the Azure resources in place, you can now start creating and provisioning devices into your Azure IoT Hub.  Here you will create several devices and configure them with the Azure IoT SDK, agents and modules to allow you to provision and utilize the security services offered by Azure.

### Task 1: Configure your devices

1. Inside the **oilwells-server-INIT** RDP session, open the Hyper-V console.

2. Select the **oilwells-edge-001** guest virtual machine.

    > **Note** It can take some time to download, unzip and mount the pre-created images so you may not see them show up immediately.

3. In the Hyper-V console, login to the VM using `wsuser` and password `S2@dmins2@dmin`

4. If prompted, select **Remind me Later** for upgrading the image.

5. Open a terminal window and run the following command:

    ```bash
    ifconfig
    ```

6. Record the `eth0` IP address.

    ![Run the ifconfig tool and look for the eth0 ip address.](media/ex1_ifconfig.png "Output of the ifconfig tool is displayed with the ip address highlighted.")

7. From the Windows 10 virtual machine host, open a PowerShell window and run the following:

    ```PowerShell
    ssh wsuser@{IP ADDRESS}
    ```

8. If prompted, type **yes**, then enter the password.

9. In the new SSH window, run the following commands. This could take up to 10 minutes to complete. You are updating and upgrading as some required packages will requires these updates.

    - Depending on your hosting environment and command line tool (cmd.exe, bash, PowerShell, etc.), you may need to run each line one at a time to avoid skipping any commands.

    - Again, depending on your hosting environment, you may find it easier to download and run these in a [Putty](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty-64bit-0.73-installer.msi) session.

    - The following commands may take 20-30 minutes to complete.

    > **Note**: You may want to open the [MCW GitHub HOL](https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Securing-Azure-IoT-solutions/blob/master/Hands-on%20lab/HOL%20step-by%20step%20-%20Securing%20Azure%20IoT%20solutions.md) document in the virtual machine to copy/paste the commands easier.

   - For Ubuntu 18.04 (Lab default), note that you may need to reboot during some of the steps:

       ```PowerShell
       sudo apt-get install -y git cmake build-essential curl

       sudo apt-get install -y libcurl4 libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev uuid-dev
       
       sudo apt-get install -y auditd audispd-plugins
       ```

   - For Ubuntu 16.04:

       ```PowerShell
       sudo apt-get install -y git cmake build-essential curl libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev uuid-dev

       sudo apt-get install -y libcurl3
       sudo apt-get install -y auditd audispd-plugins
       ```

   > **Note**: Ubuntu 20.04 will not work with these labs.

10. Repeat the steps above for the **oilwells-d01** guest virtual machine. In order to SSH into the child device `oilwells-d01`, you will need to enable SSH. Open the Hyper-V window for the `oilwells-d01`, login using the lab username and credentials, open a terminal and run the following:

    ```Powershell
    sudo apt-get install -y openssh-server

    sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    ```

    - Uncomment the `PasswordAuthentication yes` line

    ```Powershell
    sudo systemctl stop ssh
    sudo systemctl start ssh
    ```

### Task 2: Download and compile the Azure IoT SDK

1. On both virtual machines (**oilwells-d01** and **oilwells-edge-001**), run the following commands:

    > **Note**: You can find the latest release of the Azure IoT SDK [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/releases).  You can open the git to see what the latest release tag is (we reference `LTS_07_2020` below), but be aware the remainder of the lab may not work properly based on a new release.

    ```PowerShell
    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /home/wsuser
    sudo rm -rf /var/certs

    git clone https://github.com/Azure/iotedge --recursive

    sudo git clone -b LTS_07_2020_Ref01 https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c --recursive

    cd azure-iot-sdk-c

    git submodule update --init
    ```

    Determine if you have a hardware-based TPM by running the following and observing if you get any results back.

    ```bash
    dmesg | grep -i tpm
    ```

    These labs are using the latest Azure Windows 10 images and VM Compute. You should see the Microsoft Virtual TPM displayed.

    ![Output from the grep command is displayed with the Virtual TPM text is highlighted.](media/virtual-tpm.png "Virtual TPM text is highlighted")

    If you are using a `hardware-based` image (which is the case with the pre-configured lab environment), then run the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    cmake -Duse_prov_client:BOOL=ON -Duse_tpm_simulator:BOOL=OFF .
    ```

    Otherwise with a `software-based` TPM, run the following:

    ```PowerShell
    cmake -Duse_prov_client:BOOL=ON -Duse_tpm_simulator:BOOL=ON .
    ```

    Whether software or hardware, setup the new registration and endorsement key tool by running the following:

    ```PowerShell
    cd provisioning_client/tools/tpm_device_provision

    make
    ```

### Task 3: Attempt device enrollment

1. On the `oilwells-edgevm-01` device, run the following commands:

    ```PowerShell
    sudo ./tpm_device_provision
    ```

    >**Note**:  This command will fail on a device that does not have a hardware or software TPM installed.  In order to utilize a hardware-based TPM, you would need an actual device with a TPM security chip, or a nested machine with a TPM enabled virtual machine running.  The Azure ARM template provisions an Azure VM Ubuntu image that does not have a hardware TPM enabled, nor does it have a software TPM installed.  However, the Windows 10 `server` image does have a Gen2 image setup that allows nested virtualization with a Hyper-V Virtual TPM installed.  As of 08/2021, a secured Azure Virtual Machine will surface as TPM, but it is not compatible with any of the current Azure IoT code/tools/software.

    ![This shows what happens with the device does not have a hardware or software TPM.](media/ex2_image003.png "Failed TPM command")

### Task 4: Install a software TPM and Resource Manager and reattempt device enrollment

 1. If you have a hardware TPM in your device the previous command would have succeeded and you can **skip to step 6**, again you can determine if you have a TPM device by running the following and observing if you get any results back.

    ```bash
    dmesg | grep -i tpm
    ```

    > **Note**: Devices such as a Raspberry PI do not come with a TPM chip.  You can however add a TPM chip to these devices such as [this Iridium Board](https://catalog.azureiotsolutions.com/details?title=OPTIGA-TPM-SLB-9670-Iridium-Board&source=all-devices-page/).

 2. Run the following commands to download, compile and start a software-based TPM server:

    ```PowerShell
    cd

    sudo wget -c https://phoenixnap.dl.sourceforge.net/project/ibmswtpm2/ibmtpm1332.tar.gz

    sudo tar -zxvf ibmtpm1332.tar.gz

    cd ..
    sudo chown -R $USER ~/.

    cd
    cd src
    sudo make

    ./tpm_server &
    ```

    > **Note**: Press Enter to continue entering commands.

    ![The command window is showing a running software TPM.](media/ex2_image004.png "A running software TPM")

    ![With the software TPM running, a registration ID and endorsement key is generated.](media/ex2_image005.png "A running software TPM")

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
 5. Copy the device **Registration Id** and the **Endorsement Key**.  Note that you may want to do this in the virtual machine rather than typing all the information.

    >**Note**: In the real world, all your devices should have hardware-based TPMs.

 6. Repeat the above steps on the **oilwells-d01** virtual machine in the Windows 10 host.

 7. In order to SSH into the child device, you will need to enable SSH. Switch to the Hyper-V for the `oilwells-d01` and run the following:

    ```Powershell
    sudo apt-get install -y openssh-server

    sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

## Exercise 3: Install and configure IoT Edge

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise you will install the Azure IoT Edge agent on your IoT device and then register the new device with your IoT Hub.

>**Note**: You can download Ubuntu IoT Edge pre-installed virtual machine images in the Azure Marketplace.

### Task 1: Install IoT Edge

1. Switch back to your device terminal window for the **oilwells-edgevm-[YOUR INIT]** virtual machine, run the following command:

    >**Note**: Change the ubuntu version "os_version" as appropriate (`16.04` vs `18.04`).  You can get your version by running `lsb_release -a`.

    ```PowerShell
    cd

    curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/{os_version}/multiarch/prod.list > ./microsoft-prod.list

    sudo cp ./microsoft-prod.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/

    curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg

    sudo cp ./microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/

    sudo apt-get update

    sudo apt-get install -y moby-engine
    ```

2. Choose **one of the agent paths** for your environment.  If you are new to the IoT Edge, then select the latest version path:

    `<=1.1.4`

    ```PowerShell
    sudo apt-get install iotedge
    ```

    `>=1.2`

    ```PowerShell
    sudo apt-get install aziot-edge
    ```

    > **Note**: Previous versions of this lab used a version of IoT Edge (`<=1.09`), but has since been upgraded to use `1.1.4` or later. The older path is included for reference.

### Task 2: Configure the IoT Edge agent

1. Switch to the Azure Portal, open your **oilwells-prov-[YOUR INIT]** device provisioning resource.

2. In the **Overview** blade, copy the **ID Scope**.

    ![Device provisioning blade with the ID Scope highlighted.](media/ex2_image011.png "Copying the ID Scope")

3. Navigate back to the resource group and open the **oilwells-iothub-[YOUR INIT]** IoT Hub.  

4. Under **Automatic Device Management**, select **IoT Edge**.

5. Select **+Add IoT Edge device**.

    ![IoT Edge and Add an IoT Edge device links are highlighted.](media/ex2_image012.png "Adding an IoT Edge device")

6. For the Device ID, type **oilwells-edge-001**.

    ![The Create a device screen with the Device ID filled in.](media/ex2_image013.png "Create a device dialog")

7. Select **Save**.

    > **Note**: This step isn't necessary as the device provisioning service would create the device in the IoT Hub, but for the ease of flow of the lab, it is completed here.

8. Select the new **oilwells-edge-001** item, copy the primary key and primary device connection strings.

    ![The IoT Edge device dialog with the copy link highlighted for the the device primary key.](media/ex2_image014.png "Copy the primary device key")

9. Switch back to your terminal window or SSH shell, run the following command to open a text editor:

    `<=1.1.4`

    ```PowerShell
    sudo nano /etc/iotedge/config.yaml
    ```

    `>=1.2`

    ```PowerShell
    sudo cp /etc/aziot/config.toml.edge.template /etc/aziot/config.toml

    sudo nano /etc/aziot/config.toml
    ```

10. Uncomment the line and edit the host name to be `oilwells-edge-001`.

11. There are several ways to register your device with the provisioning service.  This includes manually with a device connection string, TPM registration, and symmetric key.  

    The simplest provisioning method is "manual" with a device connection string.  Each way is presented below, you need **only pick one**.  Note that TPM registration requires a software or hardware TPM.  As of 08/2021, Trusted Platform in Azure will not work, but a nested VM inside a Hyper-V image (in the case of this lab, inside Windows 10) does and **TPM is the method you should choose**.

    >**Note**: YAML file structure formats are very specific.  Be sure that the leading lines have "tabs" that are made up of only 2 space characters.

    - Manual Provisioning

        - Using the device connection string you copied from above, paste it into the `config.yaml` or `config.toml` file:

        - `<=1.1.4`

            ![The configuration file is displayed with the manual settings uncommented.](media/ex2_image008a.png "Configure TPM DPS Settings")

        - `>=1.2.0`

            ![The configuration file is displayed with the manual settings uncommented.](media/ex1_dps_tpm_v2.png "Configure TPM DPS Settings")

        - Save the file, press **CTRL-X**, then **Y**, then **Enter**.

    - Symmetric Key Provisioning

        - Comment out the manual provision settings, uncomment the **DPS symmetric key** settings, then copy in the device primary symmetric key (you will have to change the device registration to this type) and Registration ID information.

        - Save the file, press **CTRL-X**, then **Y**, then **Enter**.

    - Certificate Provisioning

        - You will need to generate a test CA certificate and then device certificates.

        - On the `server-INIT` virtual machine, open a PowerShell  window, run the following.  Be sure to replace the IoT Hub name:

            ```PowerShell

            #https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/master/tools/CACertificates/CACertificateOverview.md

            #https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-x509ca-overview#sign-devices-into-the-certificate-chain-of-trust

            mkdir "c:\certs" -ea silentlycontinue

            cd "c:\certs"

            . "C:\LabFiles\azure-iot-sdk-c\tools\CACertificates\ca-certs.ps1"

            Test-CACertsPrerequisites

            #create the CA
            New-CACertsCertChain "rsa"

            $secPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "S2@dmins2@dmin" -AsPlainText -Force;

            #create the device certs (oilwells-edge-001, oilwells002)
            New-CACertsEdgeDevice "oilwells-edge-001" -certPassword $secpassword

            Write-CACertsCertificatesForEdgeDevice "oilwells-edge-001"

            New-CACertsDevice "oilwells-d01" -certPassword $secpassword

            Write-CACertsCertificatesToEnvironment "oilwells-d01" {myIotHubName}

            New-CACertsDevice "oilwells-d02" -certPassword $secpassword

            Write-CACertsCertificatesToEnvironment "oilwells-d02" {myIotHubName}
            #>
            ```

    - TPM Provisioning

        - Comment out the manual provision settings, uncomment the **dps TPM** settings, then copy in the ID Scope and Registration ID information:

            ![The configuration file is displayed with the DPS TPM settings uncommented.](media/ex2_image008.png "Configure TPM DPS Settings")

        - Although we are using a software TPM, when using a hardware TPM, you would need to give permissions to the hardware TPM to the iotedge service by running the following commands:

        - Save the file, press **CTRL-X**, then **Y**, then **Enter**.

        ```PowerShell
        tpm0=$(sudo find /sys -name dev -print | fgrep tpm0 | sed 's/.\{4\}$//')
        tpmrm0=$(sudo find /sys -name dev -print | fgrep tpmrm0 | sed 's/.\{4\}$//')

        sudo touch /etc/udev/rules.d/tpmaccess.rules
        ```

        - Run the following command to open a text editor:

        ```PowerShell
        sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/tpmaccess.rules
        ```

        - Replace the file with the following lines and then save the file:

        `<=1.1.4`

        ```PowerShell
        # allow iotedge access to tpm0
        KERNEL=="tpm0", SUBSYSTEM=="tpm", OWNER="iotedge", GROUP="iotedge", MODE="0660"
        KERNEL=="tpmrm0", SUBSYSTEM=="tpmrm", OWNER="iotedge", GROUP="iotedge", MODE="0660"
        ```

        `>=1.2`

        ```PowerShell
        # allow iotedge access to tpm0
        KERNEL=="tpm0", SUBSYSTEM=="tpm", OWNER="aziottpm", GROUP="aziottpm", MODE="0660"
        KERNEL=="tpmrm0", SUBSYSTEM=="tpmrm", OWNER="aziottpm", GROUP="aziottpm", MODE="0660"
        ```

        - Execute the following:

        ```PowerShell
        /bin/udevadm trigger $tpm0
        /bin/udevadm trigger $tpmrm0
        ```

        - Reboot the device/machine.

        ```PowerShell
        sudo reboot
        ```

        - Login and re-open the terminal.
        - Check that access has been applied:

        ```bash
        ls -l /dev/tpm0
        ls -l /dev/tpmrm0
        ```

        - You should see something similar to the following, ensure that `iotedge` or `aziottpm` is displayed depending on your IoT Edge version:

        ```bash
        crw-rw---- 1 iotedge iotedge 10, 224 Jul 20 16:27 /dev/tpm0
        ```

12. After completing **one** of the above methods, run the following commands to restart the iotedge service:

    - `<=1.1.4`

        ```bash
        sudo systemctl restart iotedge
        sudo systemctl status iotedge
        ```

        You should see the iotedge client status as **active (running)**.  Press **Ctrl-C** to exit the status message.

        ![The Azure IoT Edge daemon shows a green active status.](media/ex2_image009.png "Successful service start")

        > **Note**: If you do not see **active (running)**, then run the following command to see diagnostics logs that may help you troubleshoot the issue:

        ```PowerShell
        sudo journalctl -u iotedge -e
        ```

    - `>=1.2`

        ```bash
        sudo iotedge config apply

        sudo iotedge system status
        ```

        You should see the iotedge services all display **Running**.

        ![Services all show Running.](media/ex3_services_v2.png "All services show running.")

        > **Note**: If you do not see **active (running)**, then run the following command to see diagnostics logs that may help you troubleshoot the issue:

        ```PowerShell
        sudo iotedge check
        ```

13. After the above configurations, the IoT Edge modules will be downloaded and created in docker containers. You can review the docker images by running (it may take a few minutes for them to initialize on first start):

    ```PowerShell
    sudo docker ps
    ```

    ![The Azure IoT Edge docker image is shown in an up state.](media/ex3_image010.png "A running docker container")

## Exercise 7: Simulate IoT attacks

Duration: 10 minutes

This exercise will have you install some "fake" processes and open some non-standard ports on your IoT device.  Once your attacks have been executed, the Security Agent will pick up these bad configurations and send them to the IoT Hub and the Azure Security Center will notify you.

### Task 1: Setup and execute attack scripts

1. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y netcat
    ```

2. Download and execute the attack script:

    ```bash
    cd

    git clone https://github.com/Azure/Azure-IoT-Security --recursive

    cd Azure-IoT-Security/trigger_events

    sudo chmod +x trigger_events.sh

    sudo ./trigger_events.sh --exploit

    sudo ./trigger_events.sh --malicious
    ```
